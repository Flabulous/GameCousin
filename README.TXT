This is the offical repo for the GameCousin emulator. All codes and resources that go into the GC will be 
kept here. 

TODO:
Get all parts required for GC (Done-ish)
Write software
Design PCB
Design Case
Get a store set up on Etsy and start selling. 

Basically it's a well thought out idea right now.
