program is split up into three main seperate threads

I have to write a program that is removed as much as possible to what it is running on so that it can be ran on anything. 
All GPIOs are going to have to be wrote to a space in memory that is picked back up by pointers to said areas in memory then


management:
main.c - Sets up the emulation enviroment for PC and kickstarts the emulator (THIS WILL HAVE TO BE EDITED TO WORK WITH OTHER SYSTEMS)
mem.c - Manages memory for all the processors

processors:
cpu.c - Emulates the SHARP LR35902
apu.c - Emulates the Audio Processing Unit
ppu.c - Emulates the Pixel Processing Unit
